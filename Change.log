CYLogger V1.0.0 features:
1. C++20 coroutine implementation
2. Double buffer queue
3. Independent lock
4. Log pattern filter
5. Log template layout
6. Exception handling
7. Simple and easy-to-use interface with cross-platform support

Included plugins:
1. CYCoroutine

2025-11-21 (build automation refresh):
1. Added CLI flags to `Build/build_all_platforms.sh` to filter platforms, build types, architectures, and shared/static flavors.
2. Ensured Linux and Android matrices always generate both static and shared libraries, with per-ABI Android API enforcement.
3. Improved dependency handling by auto-building CYCoroutine targets whenever required artifacts are missing.
4. Reworked `Build/build_android.sh` to rely on `cmake --build` and respect the unified Android toolchain detection.
5. Converted all shell-script comments to English and refreshed the README with detailed script usage and examples.
6. Documented Docker-based Linux builds and the updated Bin directory layout for universal Apple binaries.

2025-11-21 (multi-arch helpers):
1. Added `Build/build_linux_all.sh` to iterate every Linux architecture, build type, and library flavor in one command.
2. Added `Build/build_windows_all.bat` to mirror the matrix build flow on Windows hosts.
3. Updated `Build/build_windows.bat` (and README) to accept an explicit architecture argument and to generate per-arch build folders/output paths.

2025-11-21 (Windows CRT matrix):
1. Added a `CYLOGGER_MSVC_RUNTIME` CMake cache option that drives `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` and places Windows artifacts under `Bin/Windows/<arch>/<CRT>/<config>`.
2. Updated `Build/build_windows.bat` to accept a fourth argument (`MD` or `MT`), propagate it to CMake, and keep per-runtime build folders.
3. Extended `Build/build_windows_all.bat` and CYCoroutine dependency prep so the Windows matrix can iterate architectures, static/shared flavors, build types, and CRT variants in one go.

2025-11-21 (Linux build improvements):
1. Enhanced `Build/build_linux.sh` with robust architecture name normalization (supports aarch64→arm64, amd64→x86_64, etc.).
2. Added architecture-specific compiler flags: `-m32` for x86 builds and `-m64` for x86_64 builds to ensure correct bitness.
3. Replaced `make` with `cmake --build` for consistency across all build scripts and better cross-platform compatibility.
4. Fixed `Build/build_linux_all.sh` by removing incompatible `--config` parameter for single-config generators (Unix Makefiles).
5. Improved CYCoroutine dependency handling in `build_linux_all.sh` by adding `BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON` and `CYLOGGER_ROOT_DIR` to ensure correct output paths.

2025-11-21:
1. Added Android platform support with NDK r26b
2. Fixed Android-specific compilation issues with std::filesystem
3. Fixed va_list parameter issues for Android platform
4. Fixed format string security warnings
5. Added support for all Android architectures: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64
6. Organized library outputs by platform in Bin directory structure
7. Added build scripts for all platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, Android
8. Fixed architecture name inconsistencies between CYLogger and CYCoroutine
9. Added support for both static and shared libraries on all platforms
10. Improved CMake configuration for cross-platform builds

2025-04-01:
1. Fixed compilation issues for VS projects on different platforms
